# Important
This is a fork . I aim to keep master up to date to the official Zinnia with my custom additions and modifications. To make it clear what version it is based on, this fork retains the original Zinnia.Unity versioning scheme.

At this moment, no package deployment pipeline is setup. This is a state I aim to change.
To use this package you either need to check out the repository locally and use the Unity Package manager with the local repository. Or if you are on Unity 2019.2, you can point Unity to this git repository.
